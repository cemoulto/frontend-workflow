# frontend-workflow
This repository holds my (incomplete) front-end workflow boilerplate that I use when I start a new project.

To run this boilerplate on your local machine do the following:
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Open your command line tool and go into the project's folder
* Run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary packages
* Run the command `grunt dev` to start the development environment
